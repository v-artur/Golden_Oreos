<h1>Deep Learning Big Project</h1>

Team name: Golden Oreos

Team members:

Project:
Our main objective is to reconstruct the spectral features of speech from intracranial EEG data.<br>

This project is heavily reliant on the research conducted by Maxime Verwoert
et al. (for which the <a href="https://osf.io/nrgx6/" rel='nofollow'>dataset</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01542-9" rel='nofollow'>article</a> can be found here),
and we are trying to improve on it. We are aiming to replace the linear regression model described in the research with
autoencoders and transformer models.

The notebooks and scripts require Python >= 3.6 and the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- pywnb
