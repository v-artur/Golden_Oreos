<h1>Twitter analysis of American banks</h1>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> While working on the project, several dataframes were created and saved, that cannot be stored in this repo due to their size. They can be reached on the following google drive link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11N2KNv4xD2ET4AbvQu_WCHhirFBEQfOV?usp=sharing" rel='nofollow'>here</a>

Also the notebooks in their actual state are not compatible with google colab, as they were created on a personal device, on a local host in anaconda, jupyter. (Colab versions may be implemented later.)

<b>Project</b>:
Our main objective is to analyse the scraped tweets of 31 North-American banks' tweet accounts from 2012 to 2022. The tweets and some basic metadata were scraped using snscrape in python. After that, heavy amount of feature engineering was done to create more precise and specific features. The engineering of new attributes is still in progress. Using the original and engineered data, many visualizing plots were made, most important of which are available in the following drive folder:
